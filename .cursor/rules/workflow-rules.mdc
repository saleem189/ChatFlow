# Workflow Rules

This file defines the development workflow and documentation standards for the ChatFlow project.

## Commit Messages

- **Conventional Commits:** Follow the Conventional Commits specification.
  - `feat: add new chat bubble component`
  - `fix: resolve message ordering issue`
  - `chore: update dependencies`
  - `docs: update API documentation`
  - `refactor: simplify date formatting logic`

## Documentation

- **Code Comments:** Use TSDoc/JSDoc for all exported functions, classes, and interfaces. Explain *why* something is done, not just *what* it does.
- **README:** Keep the project README and feature-specific READMEs up to date.
- **Self-Documenting Code:** Prioritize clear variable and function names over comments.

## Pull Requests

- **Description:** All PRs must have a description explaining the changes, the "why", and how to test them.
- **Checklist:** Ensure all tests pass, linting is clean, and no new build warnings are introduced before requesting review.
