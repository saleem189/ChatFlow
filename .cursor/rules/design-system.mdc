# Design System Rules

This file defines the design system guidelines and UI/UX standards for the ChatFlow project.

## Simplicity

- **No Over-engineering:** Avoid complex solutions when simple ones suffice. Do not add features or abstractions "just in case".

## Component Usage

- **Shared Components:** Always prefer using shared UI components (e.g., from `components/ui/`) over raw HTML elements.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistent spacing, typography, and colors by using Tailwind CSS utility classes defined in the theme.

## Tailwind CSS

- **Tokens:** Use standard Tailwind spacing and color tokens (e.g., `p-4`, `text-primary`) instead of arbitrary values (e.g., `p-[16px]`, `text-[#123456]`).
- **Responsiveness:** Design mobile-first. Use `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` prefixes to adjust layouts for larger screens.
- **Dark Mode:** Ensure all components support dark mode using the `dark:` prefix or CSS variables.

## Accessibility

- **Interactive Elements:** All buttons and links must have accessible names (text content or `aria-label`).
- **Images:** All images must have meaningful `alt` text.
- **Contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast for text and interactive elements.

## Aesthetics

- **Premium Feel:** Use subtle animations (framer-motion), gradients, and glassmorphism where appropriate to enhance the user experience.
- **Feedback:** Provide immediate visual feedback for user actions (hover states, loading spinners, toast notifications).
