# Testing Rules

This file defines the testing strategy and rules for the ChatFlow project.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- **Scope:** Components, hooks, and utility functions.
- **Tools:** Jest, React Testing Library.
- **Location:** `__tests__/unit/` or co-located with the file (e.g., `component.test.tsx`).

### Integration Tests
- **Scope:** API routes, services, and complex flows.
- **Tools:** Jest, Supertest (for API).
- **Location:** `__tests__/integration/`.

## Best Practices

- **Providers:** Use `renderWithProviders` helper for testing components that rely on context (Theme, Auth, Query).
- **Mocking:** Mock external services and API calls. Do not make real network requests in tests.
- **Coverage:** Aim for high test coverage on critical paths (Authentication, Payment, Data persistence).
