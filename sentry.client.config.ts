// ================================
// Sentry Client Configuration
// ================================
// NOTE: This file is kept for reference but Sentry.init() is called in instrumentation-client.ts
// According to Sentry docs, when both files exist, initialization should happen in instrumentation-client.ts
// 
// Official Docs: https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/
// Setup Guide: https://chatflow.sentry.io/onboarding/setup-docs/
//
// All client-side Sentry configuration is now in instrumentation-client.ts
// This file is kept for backwards compatibility but does not initialize Sentry
